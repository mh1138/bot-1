This is a freee to use discord bot, that analyses different sneaker webistes to summarize the price and other details of the shoe.
It is written in python and is pretty long.
bot-1 is my first real project with python and there are probably many errors in the Code.
I will comment the code when im done.

The use of this bot is on your own danger and can result in consequences due to unpermitted scraping etc.

Message me with suggestions and i will try to get them done
